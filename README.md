# Global Air Pollution Mortality Analysis

A simple data visualization project that explores air pollution and its impact using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Goal

This project analyzes air quality and pollution-related data to identify patterns and present insights through charts.

## Main Files

- `air_pollution_impact.ipynb` — main notebook with analysis and visualizations
- `air_quality.csv` — air quality dataset
- `data.csv` — supporting dataset used in analysis

## Output Visuals

The repository also includes generated visual images such as:

- `line_chart.png`
- `pm.png`
- `gender_based.png`
- `top_10_D.png`
- `bottom_10_D.png`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `air_pollution_impact.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Install dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```
4. Run all notebook cells.

## Notes

- This project is built for learning and data visualization practice.
- Data files are included in the repository for reproducibility.
